# MDP
Markov Decision Process for AVT testing. Calculates the transition probabilities for each state (sum to 1) based on an input list of sequences. 

To run tests:
``` Python
python test.py -v
```

Look at test.py for detailed example of input sequences. Uncomment 2 functions __printInput and __printOutput to see detailed sequence on each run.
